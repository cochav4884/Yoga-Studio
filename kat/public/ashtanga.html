    <p class="lorem">Whether you are new to yoga or looking to advance your practice, Ashtanga Yoga is for every
        healthy, unique being. <br><br>

        Instructions will be given throughout the warm-up, as well as the standing, seated, and closing sequences.
        Postures can certainly be modified at anytime as you gain strength, learn balance, and optimize your breath. The
        opening and closing chants (in Sanskrit) are included and optional as you expand your yoga knowledge and
        philosophy. All the Sanskrit posture names, breath count, and transitions are outlined in a color based,
        printable cheat sheet to help you memorize the sequence as your practice progresses. General strength training
        drills and movements are designed to compliment your practice. The practice of yoga can be very healing as it
        promotes circulation, improves joint mobility, and helps your daily movements by mitigating injury. <br><br>

        Overall, students will enjoy being led by an authorized instructor as well as challenged individually to explore
        their own strength, flexibility, and mental resilience. The course is designed to allow you to learn at your own
        pace with reference materials for support. Additionally, if you are a registered yoga school or professional
        organizing workshops or supporting in-person clients, this course will compliment your offerings. Enjoy this
        course with unlimited viewing and LIFE-time access. All levels are welcome.
