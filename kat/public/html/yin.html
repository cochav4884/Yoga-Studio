    <p class="lorem">This yin yoga class is designed to stretch the lower back, sides of the body, and hamstrings.
        You'll practice half butterfly (or a variation of it) and a supine twist (or a variation of it) and then relax
        in savasana.
        Take this time to quiet your mind and ease into your day. <br><br>

        The essence of Yin yoga is surrender. It focuses on postures that lengthen the muscles surrounding the hips,
        pelvis, and lower back. Students typically hold these postures for 3-10 minutes per side in order to lengthen
        the connective tissue that surrounds the joints and increase its elasticity. Since a Yin yoga practice often
        includes several long, seated forward bending postures, it also restores energy and calms the nervous system.
        <br><br>

        When stretched regularly, a Yin Yoga sequence can increase the overall flexibility, circulation, and range of
        motion of the joints and fascia. It's such a relief that you can learn how to use and practice a Yin Yoga
        sequence to complement your yang yoga practice. <br><br>

        Importantly, In Yin Yoga sequences the use of muscles is kept to a minimum. As the poses are to be held for a
        longer duration, the use of props like cushions and bolsters is essential. It is also very important to breathe
        correctly during a Yin Yoga sequence of asanas. The emphasis is on relaxed belly breathing. When we take long,
        slow, and deep breaths we allow our body to relax, enabling us to be in a pose for a longer duration of time.
