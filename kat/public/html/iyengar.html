    <p class="lorem">Iyengar Yoga is a style of yoga steeped in tradition, anatomy, and physiology. It's designed to
        adapt to the individual and encourages the use of props to maintain the integrity of your body. It focuses on
        precision and alignment, making it ideal for all levels, especially beginners, those recovering from an injury,
        or anyone looking to refine their practice. <br><br>

        The Iyengar style of yoga provides a comprehensive framework for beginners learning yoga for the first time.
        This very structured introduction ensures that a solid foundation is established. As a result, more meaningful
        and consistent progress can be made, allowing the individual to reap more of the benefits of yoga. <br><br>

        The benefits of yoga can be broadly conceived as being physical, psychological and spiritual. Most people are
        familiar with the manner in which yoga improves flexibility and increases muscle tone and strength. In order to
        achieve this there is a high degree of mental focus and concentration required. Hence regular yoga practice also
        develops this capacity. <br><br>

        Yoga teaches techniques for becoming more aware and mindful of your physical and mental state. Becoming more
        aware of your stress levels is the first step towards being able to reduce them. Yoga provides the individual
        with methods and techniques for letting go and relaxing. With regular practice, baseline levels of stress become
        lower and sleep quality is often improved. <br><br>

        Yoga is a very useful tool for athletes and active people. It can protect against injury and assist with
        recovery from intense physical exercise that might tighten and strain the muscles and joints. <br><br>

        More global benefits include improved balance, increased energy, improved confidence, a more positive self-image
        and a general sense of wellbeing. <br><br>

        The benefits of yoga are also being increasingly realised and acknowledged in the medical world. Yoga has been
        the focus of research for some time and has been recommended by health professionals for a range of reasons.
        These include psychological difficulties such as anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. Yoga is
        also increasingly being recognised as a beneficial intervention for chronic back pain sufferers.
