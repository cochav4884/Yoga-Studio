        <h1>Hatha</h1>
    </header>

    <p class="lorem">This class begins with seated poses, then raises us up from the floor to work on stretching the
        spine and finding alignment and ease in common postures such as downward-facing dog. Ideally, we're happier
        after a yoga practice than when we got on the mat, and these practices help us get there. <br><br>

        The specific format of a hatha yoga session will vary from teacher to teacher and class to class, but usually,
        classes begin with some sort of "centering exercise," says Maria. This might be in a seated position or on your
        back and may involve a simple guided meditation, a breathing exercise, or even just a moment of silence.
        <br><br>

        From there, the teacher may guide you through a series of movements (think twisting, bending, folding) that
        build toward a "peak pose." Then, once you achieve that pose, you may do a series of movements to counterbalance
        some of the previous poses from class, to make sure you leave feeling "balanced," says Maria. Or the class might
        not be centered on a "peak pose" at all and instead could incorporate a variety of postures like standing poses,
        reclining poses, balance poses, and twists. <br><br>

        Hatha also focuses on breathwork timed to movements (typically at a slower pace than what you might experience
        in vinyasa), and classes could include meditation and chanting as well. <br><br>

        No matter what format your hatha class follows, know that you don't have to do every single pose, and you also
        don't have to hold poses for as long as the instructor says. It's more than OK to break poses early or even opt
        out completely and simply sit or stand quietly. "You can take a break anytime you need <to class="br"><br></to>

        On the equipment front, a yoga mat is your only must-have. Pro tip: If you buy a brand-new mat, wash it at home
        first before taking it to class, says Maria. Why? "Most mats have a factory coating on them that's slippery,"
        she explains, which means that if you use it straight from the store (or box), you're likely going to slide
        around.
