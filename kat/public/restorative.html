    <p class="lorem">
        In our busy and stressful world, we all need a little more time for ourselves, a little more time to soften and
        absorb, to relax and release, and to simply let go and become more present. We all need restoration in our
        lives! Whether we feel burned out from overworking our bodies, mentally exhausted from our job or from
        parenting, or just constantly stressed and tired, we must make time for renewal and self-care to maintain our
        good health and well-being. <br><br>

        Restorative Yoga for Relaxation and Rejuvenation is a balanced sequence of restorative poses for relief of
        stress, anxiety and tension. This course offers complete video instructions for each pose of the sequence. The
        use of props for each pose is shown in detail so that anyone, regardless of previous experience, can follow and
        experience the transformative effect and deep relaxation that restorative yoga has to offer. <br><br>

        Yoga teachers will learn to assist students in restorative yoga poses; including assisting in prop set up,
        modifications and adjustments for each student's individual needs. <br><br>

        This course is offered by Satya Greenstone. In the Tradition and Lineage of Sri Swami Satchidananda; Satya has
        been practicing and teaching yoga for 46 years. <br><br>

        Restore yourself to your natural state of balance through the gentle supported poses of Restorative Yoga for
        Relaxation and Rejuvenation</p>
