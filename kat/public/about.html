    <!-- Hatha-->
    <a id="SO1"></a>
    <h2>Hatha</h2>
    <div class="flip-card">
        <div class="flip-card-inner">
            <div class="flip-card-front">
                <img src="img/hathayoga.jpg" alt="hatha" style="width:600px;height:400px;">
            </div>
            <div class="flip-card-back">
                <h1>Hatha</h1>
                <p>Less anxiety, better balance, and fitness improvements</p>
                <a href="hatha.html"><button class="btn btn-outline-secondary">Hatha</button></a>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="lorem">Though Hatha refers to the branch of Yoga focused on the asanas, it also exists as a
        generic style of Yoga that we see today. Perhaps one of the best places for beginners to start is a
        Hatha Yoga class as they tend to be slow, and on the gentle side.</p>

    <!-- Yin -->
    <a id="S02"></a>
    <h2>Yin</h2>
    <div class="flip-card">
        <div class="flip-card-inner">
            <div class="flip-card-front">
                <img src="img/yinyoga.jpg" alt="yin" style="width:600px;height:400px;">
            </div>
            <div class="flip-card-back">
                <h1>Yin</h1>
                <p>Injury prevention, joint health, and restorative energy</p>
                <a href="yin.html"><button class="btn btn-outline-secondary">Yin</button></a>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="lorem">Yin is a relaxing style of Yoga that targets the deep connective tissues of the body and strives to
        calm and balance the mind. The poses are either done seated on laying down and each one is held for 45 seconds
        to two minutes. Unlike most other styles of Yoga, the positions are passive and students are encouraged to relax
        into the pose, letting gravity do most of the world. You will leave a good Yin class feeling relaxed and
        refreshed.</p>

    <!-- Vinyasa -->
    <a id="S03"></a>
    <h2>Vinyasa</h2>
    <div class="flip-card">
        <div class="flip-card-inner">
            <div class="flip-card-front">
                <img src="img/vinyasayoga.jfif" alt="vinyasa" style="width:600px;height:400px;">
            </div>
            <div class="flip-card-back">
                <h1>Vinyasa</h1>
                <p>Linking counscious breath with dynamic fluid movement</p>
                <a href="vinyasa.html"><button class="btn btn-outline-secondary">Vinyasa</button></a>

            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="lorem">This may be the most popular style of Yoga found today- Vinyasa is often synonymous with “flow
        yoga” or other similar terms. The style is more athletic but still suitable for beginners because teachers
        usually offer multiple variations on each pose and encourage students to take the practice at their own pace.
        Distinctive characteristics include flowy sequences where each pose is connected to one another and the
        movements are synced up with the breath.</p>

    <!-- Ashtanga -->
    <a id="S04"></a>
    <h2>Ashtanga</h2>
    <div class="flip-card">
        <div class="flip-card-inner">
            <div class="flip-card-front">
                <img src="img/ashtangayoga.jpg" alt="ashtanga" style="width:600px;height:400px;">
            </div>
            <div class="flip-card-back">
                <h1>Ashtanga</h1>
                <p>Produces inner warmth to purify muscles and organs</p>
                <a href="ashtanga.html"><button class="btn btn-outline-secondary">Ashtanga</button></a>

            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="lorem">If you are versed in Yogic philosophy, seeing an “Ashtanga Yoga” class may confuse you because in
        Sanskrit Ashtanga Yoga refers to the “eight-limb path,” or the eight steps laid out by Sage Patanjali that a
        Yoga practitioner can follow to reach the highest form of meditation. However today when you see Ashtanga Yoga
        advertised it probably refers to the style coined by K. Pattabhi Jois that works with a specific series of
        postures, which are very physically demanding and challenging. For this reason, we wouldn't recommend beginners
        venture into an Ashtanga Yoga class. But for more experienced Yogis looking to build strength and discipline in
        your mind and body, this may be just the right style for you.</p>

    <!-- Kundalini -->
    <a id="S05"></a>
    <h2>Kundalini</h2>
    <div class="flip-card">
        <div class="flip-card-inner">
            <div class="flip-card-front">
                <img src="img/kungaliniyoga.jpg" alt="kundalini" style="width:600px;height:400px;">
            </div>
            <div class="flip-card-back">
                <h1>Kundalini</h1>
                <p>Feel great and have boundless engergy</p>
                <a href="kundalini.html"><button class="btn btn-outline-secondary">Kundalini</button></a>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="lorem">What has become known as Kundalini Yoga is an interesting blend between Bhakti Yoga and Raja Yoga,
        meaning that it combines devotional qualities of Yoga with movements aiming to control the mind and body. The
        practice focuses on releasing what's known as kundalini energy, a powerful force that lays dormant at the bottom
        of your spine. Kundalini classes work on this through intense, invigorating postures, dynamic breathing
        exercises, chanting and mantras. You may find yourself challenged mentally as much as physically in one of these
        classes.</p>

    <!-- Bikram -->
    <a id="S06"></a>
    <h2>Bikram</h2>
    <div class="flip-card">

            </div>
            <div class="flip-card-back">
                <h1>Bikram</h1>
                <p>Radiate strength, confidence, and a calm resilient mind</p>

    </div>
    <p class="lorem">If you're looking for a good sweat, this might be just what you're looking for, but beware that the
        room is heated to a humid 105 degrees F (40 degrees C). No matter where you practice Bikram Yoga, you will find
        the same 26 postures, each performed twice. The founder Bikram Choudhury claims that the series of poses is
        scientifically designed to oxygenate your entire body in a proper sequence and restore all bodily systems to a
        healthy working order.</p>

    <!-- Restorative -->
    <a id="S07"></a>
    <h2>Restorative</h2>
    <div class="flip-card">
        <div class="flip-card-inner">
            <div class="flip-card-front">

                <a href="restorative.html"><button class="btn btn-outline-secondary">Restorative</button></a>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="lorem">Like the name might have you guess, this style of Yoga is deeply calming and relaxing. Restorative
        Yoga includes passive stretching and poses held for several minutes; an hour long class may only include 5-6
        poses. The classes typically rely on props to help students find complete comfort ease in each position. When
        you need to wind down from a long day or reset your body and mind, treat yourself to some Restorative Yoga.</p>

    <h2>Iyengar</h2>

            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="lorem">Iyengar Yoga is a style of Yoga founded by B.K.S. Iyengar that focuses on alignment and precise
        movements. The poses in these classes are typically held for longer and rely heavily on props to help students
        get into the proper positioning. Once students have the proper alignment, they can deepen the pose, working to
        build strength, flexibility and body awareness. Iyengar Yoga is suitable for any level of Yoga practitioners and
        particularly good as a therapeutic Yoga for people with injuries.</p>
