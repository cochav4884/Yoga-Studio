    <p class="lorem">A unique blend of movement and meditation, Kundalini Yoga needs to be experienced to be fully
        understood. Generate a shift in your energy with this powerful practice while learning its core concepts and
        techniques. This program will familiarize newcomers with all the essentials of a Kundalini class, including
        breathwork, bandhas (energetic locks), and mantra meditation, as well as introduce two dynamic kriyas to build
        mental balance and inner strength. <br><br>

        The result : Your life will become instantly more amazing, because when you feel great, you start doing the
        things you really want to do, and the people around you will know notice the difference immediately. They will
        want to know why you are suddenly so much happier, with so much time and energy for the things and people that
        are really important in your life. <br><br>

        If you sometimes feel a bit stuck, or a bit lost perhaps, the techniques I will show you here will get your
        energy flowing again. This will enable you to regain the clarity of purpose, direction and energy that you need
        to give greater meaning and clarity to your life. <br><br>

        Say goodbye to feelings like apathy, depression and inertia, which we all experience from time to time! I will
        help you find the unlimited energy within your body that will get you fully inspired and engaged in life, so
        that you can take your life to the next level. You will start to live the life you always dreamed of, filled
        with deep JOY. <br><br>

        It doesn't matter if you have never done one single Yoga class in your life, and can't touch your toes because
        you do not need to be flexible. Absolutely no experience is needed for this course, everything is very simple
        and clearly explained for you to practice, as you are right now! <br><br>

        Equally, if you have done other forms of Yoga, but feel that there is something missing, then let me reveal the
        secret of how and why Kundalini Yoga is something extra special.
